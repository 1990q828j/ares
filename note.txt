Note:
1. IRasterProps.NoDataValue actually is a Int32[].
2. The index of item does not start from 0.
3. The col and row index obtained from the program starts from 0.
4. x = Column, y = row

Protential Improvement:
1. # For Com Version # If a cell of raster grid view enters the editing mode, it will be marked as edited even without value change.
3. # Improtant # Multiple selection modes: add, subtract

Potential Bug:
1. Start edit while two identical layers are loaded.
